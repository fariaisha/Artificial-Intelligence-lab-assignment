AI Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and explanations of different AI Search Algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence and problem-solving. These algorithms are widely applied in pathfinding, decision-making, optimization, and game playing.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
1. Uninformed Search Algorithms (Blind Search)

Uninformed search algorithms do not have additional information about states beyond the problem definition.

Examples:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Uniform Cost Search

Depth-Limited Search

Iterative Deepening Search

2. Informed Search Algorithms (Heuristic Search)

Informed search uses problem-specific knowledge (heuristics) to guide the search more efficiently.

Examples:

Greedy Best-First Search

A* Algorithm

Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)

3. Local Search Algorithms

Local search algorithms operate using a single current state and move to neighboring states. They are useful for optimization problems.

Examples:

Hill Climbing

Simulated Annealing

Genetic Algorithms

4. Adversarial Search Algorithms

Used in competitive environments like games where agents act against each other.

Examples:

Minimax Algorithm

Alpha-Beta Pruning

5. Online Search Algorithms

Online search is performed when the agent does not have complete knowledge of the environment beforehand and must learn while exploring.

Examples:

Online Depth-First Search

Learning Real-Time A* (LRTA*)

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus: Other Specialized Algorithms

Additional algorithms and variations may also be included.# Artificial-Intelligence-lab-assignment
